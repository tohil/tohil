### Hi there 👋

#### My name is Artem Zhuravlov, and I am a software developer from Kyiv, Ukraine.

I have over ten years of experience in programming, with a primary focus on backend development. My career spans a period when the distinction between frontend and backend was less pronounced, giving me substantial experience in frontend development as well.

 - 🎯 Backend: Perl, Mojolicious, Dancer, Node.js, PHP
 - 🌐 Frontend: JavaScript, TypeScript, ReactJS/Redux
 - 🛠️ Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, NoSQL (Firestore, Redis)
 - 🚀 Tools: Webpack, Composer, npm, Docker, Git
 - 🌐 Web Services: REST APIs, GraphQL
 - 📦 Other: AWS (MTurk, Rekognition), Apache/Nginx, OOP, FP, TDD, SCRUM

I have worked on various projects for both large and medium-sized companies targeting markets in the UK, Portugal, and Finland. My skills cover all aspects from development and integration to testing and documentation.

I am adaptable to new technologies, a quick learner, and always ready for challenges in the field of software development. My goal is to provide quality solutions and contribute my experience to the team to achieve common objectives.

#### Live long and prosper! 🖖
